# fluttercountryweatherapplication

Building this application as an exam for Flutter Developer INternship with ZAQ. 

To install this project on your device and test it, you can either download it as zip folder from the code button and open the folder in your prefered IDE. Android Studio is recommended. Your machine should have installed Flutter SDK. 
Or you can download it using CLI with the git command: git install https://github.com/sudo-riham/fluttercountryapplication/

Please note that it may take up to 30 seconds (or a bit more) to first load. Please be aware that I didn't all the required tasks. You can save any country you want, however the country you just saved won't load directly in the list screen. We have to close the application and load it again to see the saved countries. I am still trying to figure out why the country isn't loaded directly.
Here are some snapshots from my application:
